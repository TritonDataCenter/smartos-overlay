# If DHCP was used on a primary interface then set the hostname
# that was returned. If no hostname was returned, set the name
# to be "unknown". The hostname must be set to something, because
# tooltalk will hang unless the name can be locally resolved.
# Sendmail also requires the name to be resolvable locally.
# Later, in inetsvc, we create a name "unknown" and create a entry
# in the local /etc/inet/hosts file pairing "unknown" with the IP
# address assigned by DHCP.  The use of bootparams as a fallback
# for all non-DHCP cases provides compatibility with the
# behavior of the system before netstrategy was introduced.
#
# For non-global zones, fall back to the `uname -n` value provided by the
# kernel if /etc/nodename does not exist, as is expected on an initial boot.
